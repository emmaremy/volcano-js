# Volcano explorer
### (d3.js edition)

A year or so ago, I created [this visualization of volcanic eruptions](https://github.com/emmaremy/minimalvolcano) using data from the [Global Volcanism Program](http://volcano.si.edu/). I decided to re-create this using d3.js.

[At this link](https://emmaremy.github.io/volcano-js/) there are both 3d and 2d maps with points indicating volcanic eruptions. The process to build these was surprisingly arduous, on account of I had no idea what I was doing.

I intend to continue to alter these to be more legitimately informative, so please excuse any mess at the live link.

Please feel free to use this code to any ends you desire. The majority of it I stole myself from [Mike Bostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7ea1dde508cec6d2d95306f92642bc42), and if I'd found someone else's implementation of "points on a moving globe using canvas" I would have been overjoyed and also stolen that code.
